    summary: |
      Hello, I am Simok Lee.
      I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.jeongresearch.org/"><u>Bio-Integrated Electronics and Systems
      Lab (BIESL)</u></a> in <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/"><u>KAIST</u></a>.
      I am currently advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.jeongresearch.org/current/"><u>Jae-Woong Jeong</u></a>.
      My research interest lies in developing human-like electronic skins that are soft, flexible, and stretchable using gallium microgranules.
      I design and apply these skins on non-human objects including robotic skins for diverse applications in robotics and human health monitoring.

      I received my B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engieering with minor in Electrical Engineering from KAIST in 2021.
      I spent a year pursuing M.S. in Electrical Engineering until I enrolled in the Integrated Ph.D. program in 2022.
#      In 2020, I worked as an intern in <a href="https://www.samsungsem.com/kr/index.do"><u>Samsung Electro-Mechanics</u></a>,
#      where I did blah blah.
